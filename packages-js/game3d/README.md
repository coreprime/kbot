# KBot game3d

A self-contained WebGL renderer for Total Annihilation-style scenes from
[coreprime/kbot](https://github.com/coreprime/kbot): 3DO model geometry, GAF
textures, palette-resolved flat shading, COB-posed piece trees, terrain / sky /
water environments, shadows, LOD, particles and weapon effects. No three.js,
no host server.

game3d is the **view only** — it draws whatever unit/projectile state it is
given and knows no game rules. Simulation (movement, combat, the COB script
VM) belongs to a driver such as [`@kbot/engine`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kbot/engine),
whose per-tick snapshots map straight onto `applyState()`. All asset I/O goes
through one injected **AssetProvider** — the renderer itself never fetches.

## Install

This package is published publicly on npmjs.org, so no registry or auth
configuration is needed to consume it:

```
npm install @kbot/game3d
```

(Publishing needs a token — CI authenticates with
`//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}`, sourced from the
environment; never commit a literal token.)

## Use

```js
import { createWorld } from '@kbot/game3d'

const world = await createWorld(canvas, { assets: myProvider })
const id = await world.addUnit('armpw', { x: 0, z: 0 })
world.step(16)                          // render one frame (or autoStart: true)
world.moveUnit(id, { x: 40, heading: Math.PI / 2 })
world.applyState(engineSnapshot)        // full per-tick state from a sim
world.fireWeapon({ from: [0, 20, 0], to: [200, 0, 200] })
world.dispose()
```

`createWorld` also exposes the underlying stack (`renderer`, `camera`,
`loader`, `palette`, `textureCache`) for deep-integration hosts; every class
is importable individually (`@kbot/game3d/model-renderer`, …) and shares
module state with the root entry.

## Game conventions (headings + COB pieces)

`cob-pose.js` (exported from the root) is the single source of truth for the
game's pose conventions, matched against the original engine:

- **World axes**: +X east, +Y up, +Z south — a map renders the same way as
  its minimap.
- **Heading**: uint16 TA angle, 65536 per turn. Heading 0 faces **−Z
  (north)**; a unit at heading `h` moves along `(-sin, -cos)` of
  `h·2π/65536`, and the compass walks north → west → south → east. Feed raw
  wire/recording headings through `headingToRadians(h)` — no offsets, no
  sign fix-ups — into `transform.headingRad` / `applyState`'s `heading`.
- **COB piece transforms**: axis 0 = x (pitch, positive = nose down),
  1 = y (yaw, positive turns with increasing heading), 2 = z (roll). Convert
  engine piece state with `enginePieceToPose` / `unpackEnginePieces`, and
  apply it **by name** through the unit's COB piece table with
  `applyPackedPieces` — COB table order is not the model hierarchy order
  (a Samson lists its launcher flares before its body).

Maps: `loadMapTerrain(provider, name)` composites a packed map's tile atlas
into the full ground texture and returns the arguments
`renderer.setMapTerrain()` (or `world.setTerrain()`) takes, plus sea level,
start positions and the authentic minimap URL.  Beyond the map rect the
world renders an infinite dark Tron-style void grid (glowing lines, depth
fade; `renderer.voidGridEnabled = false` to disable) instead of the light
sky backdrop; the studio's flat-pad scenes are unaffected.

**Map features**: `world.setTerrain(terrain)` also installs the map's
features (toggle with `setFeaturesEnabled(on)`, or pass
`{ features: false }`).  GAF-sprite features (trees, rocks, kelp,
props…) become deterministic low-poly 3D stand-ins built per CATEGORY —
shapes that read correctly from TA's classic angle and survive orbiting —
sized from the pack's `features.json` (format v5) footprint/height/sprite
dims and seeded per (name, cell) so every run bakes identical geometry.
Ground-set categories render as FLAT terrain-conforming decals instead:
metal deposits as dark paneled plates, geothermal steam vents as a
scorched vent mouth that puffs a live fx-clock-driven steam wisp.
Features with real 3DO models (wrecks, dragon teeth) place the actual
packed model.  The whole field bakes into a handful of static batches —
one draw call each, no per-feature frame cost (`buildFeatureField` is
exported for standalone use).

## Replay presentation

Everything a state-driven consumer (a replay renderer) needs to make a
world read like the game, all presentation-only — no sim state, no hashes:

- **Weapon effects** — `world.weaponEffect({ weapon: '<id>', from, to })`
  resolves the id against the pack's `weapons.json` and draws the weapon's
  authentic visual: palette-tinted laser pulse beams, the D-gun fireball
  with its flame trail and scene-washing light, the packed projectile 3DO
  flying a TRUE trajectory — ballistic arcs solved to land on the target,
  guided missiles steering at the TDF `turnrate` and detonating on
  proximity, torpedoes holding depth under the sea sheet with bubble
  trails (format v5 fields) — fx.gaf bitmap bolts, or AoE-scaled particle
  tracers, plus muzzle flash, start-smoke and the impact.  Impacts route
  through the polygonal explosion system (below); at/below the waterline
  they splash (spray + bubbles + foam ring) instead of burning.  Explicit
  `color`/`durationMs`/`velocity` override the def; `type:
  'beam'|'tracer'` without a weapon keeps the raw line-effect path.
- **Explosions** — every impact/death detonates a polygonal 3D explosion
  (expanding emissive fireball polyhedron + spinning shards + ground
  shockwave ring, additive so the cinematic bloom lifts it) sized by a
  small/medium/large/huge ladder off `areaOfEffect` + death severity.
  Readability is enforced: per-hit effects are brief and tight, spawns
  coalesce per area bucket instead of stacking, a global concurrency cap
  recycles records, and sqrt-law luminance budgets dim both the additive
  particles and the dynamic lights as a barrage grows — the field stays
  readable under any bombardment (see `explosion-fx.js` +
  `performance.js` for the tunables and rationale).
- **Death** — `world.unitDeath(id, { severity, corpse, heapCorpse,
  impactDir, impactMag })` follows TA's corpsetype ladder: a clean kill
  (severity < 50) swaps in the wreck 3DO (pack unitdb
  `meta.corpseObject`), sunk slightly and persistent until
  `removeCorpse(id)`/`clearCorpses()`; heavier kills throw the unit's
  pieces as tumbling debris — parabolic world-space arcs that spin,
  bounce off the terrain with energy loss and settle before fading, with
  `impactDir` ([x,z], source → victim) biasing the scatter away from the
  killing blow.  Airborne units (`air: true`) instead enter a spiral
  crash: a spinning, smoking descent that detonates where it meets the
  terrain or splashes into the sea.  The applyState form: a live unit
  re-sent with `dead: true` (+ `deathSeverity`/`corpse`/`heapCorpse`/
  `impactDir`/`impactMag`) triggers the same path once.
- **Air / sea flags** — applyState `air: true` adds a hover bob,
  bank-into-turns and contrails at speed (and the spiral-crash death);
  `hover: true` the hovercraft cushion gyration — a gentle lean computed
  about WORLD axes, so the tilt direction holds steady while the craft
  yaws; `naval: true` a stern
  foam wake while the vessel is under way on the sea sheet.  Units
  crossing the waterline splash.
- **Economy visuals** — `world.latheBeam(key, { fromUnitId, toUnitId })`
  streams the green nano spray onto a build target while its
  `buildPercent` drives the rising wireframe→solid hull (the lathe line
  glows at the cut); `world.reclaimBeam(key, { fromUnitId, corpseId })`
  reverses the stream and shrinks the wreck while beamed;
  `world.captureFlash(id)` plays the capture pulse.  Building activity
  (extractor rotors, solar collectors) is driven through the ENGINE —
  `Session.setUnitActivation(unitId, on)` runs the unit's real COB
  Activate/Deactivate entry points.
- **Grounding + slope tilt** — applyState/addUnit `grounded: true` clamps a
  unit's render Y to the battlefield surface (`world.terrainHeightAt`) and
  pitches/rolls it to the terrain normal.  Recorded wire Y is TA world
  units where the surface sits at rawHeight × 1.0; the renderer draws
  terrain flattened by `heightScale` (0.61), so un-clamped Y must be scaled
  by the same factor — `grounded` sidesteps the conversion entirely.
- **Hit rock** — `world.unitImpulse(id, { dirX, dirZ, mag })` shudders the
  unit on a damped spring (call it on damage events).  Structures stay
  planted: pass `mobile: false` on the unit (addUnit/applyState) — or rely
  on the built-in inference, which treats a grounded unit that has never
  moved or yawed as a building.
- **Status** — per-unit `hp01` (0..1) draws a green→red health bar under
  the unit while damaged and drives TA-style damage smoke; `rank` (0..5)
  draws a row of gold veteran stars beneath the bar — only while the bar
  itself shows, so a full-health unit carries no rank chrome.  Both
  render in the scene pass —
  depth-tested against the world, so a unit behind a ridge shows no bar —
  and headless captures include them.
- **COB smoke** — forward engine render events through
  `applyState({ events })` / `world.sfxEvent(ev)`: `emitSfx` plumes
  (SmokeUnit threads) and `explode` flashes render at their anchors.
- **Smooth frames** — `lerpPackedPieces(prev, next, alpha)` blends engine
  piece buffers with shortest-arc rotations; applyState renders
  externally-lerped positions/headings as-is.
- **Quality** — `createWorld({ quality: 'cinematic' })` (or
  `world.setQuality`) adds bloom, the ACES grade and FXAA over the
  always-on specular/metal hints, blinking running lights, god beams and
  dynamic weapon lights.  Explicitly-stepped worlds drive the renderer's
  effect clock from `step(dtMs)`, keeping every animated effect a pure
  function of the fed timeline.
- **Team colours** — `TA_TEAM_SIDES` (exported) is the default side →
  colour table; pass a unit `side` (0..7) through applyState and the
  hue-shift recolour applies.

## The AssetProvider seam

Implement this interface against any asset backend and pass it as
`{ assets }` (or call `setAssetProvider()` directly). Required methods:

```ts
palette(): Promise<[r, g, b][]>                      // 256-entry palette
model(name, { enhanceMesh? }): Promise<ModelGeometry> // preprocessed 3DO tree
texture(name): Promise<Blob | ImageBitmap | HTMLImageElement>
```

Optional (the renderer degrades gracefully without them): `script` (COB),
`groundTile`, `sound` / `soundUrl`, `cursor` / `cursorUrl`, `weaponBitmap`,
and — for drivers built on top of the renderer — `manifest`, `unitDB`, `map`.
See `index.d.ts` for the full contract.

Implementations:

- **StudioAssetProvider** — ships with the KBot Studio web client and wraps
  the studio server's asset API; the studio sandbox runs on it.
- **HttpPackProvider** — exported from this package: serves a static
  pre-extracted asset pack (`kbot pack` output) from a plain HTTP base URL;
  no server logic needed.

  ```js
  import { createWorld, HttpPackProvider } from '@kbot/game3d'
  const world = await createWorld(canvas, {
    assets: new HttpPackProvider('https://cdn.example.com/packs/ta-31c'),
  })
  ```
- **HpiProvider** *(planned)* — reads original HPI/UFO archives directly in
  the browser.

## Building from source

`npm run build` (in `packages-js/game3d/`) embeds the GLSL under `shaders/**`
and the world JSON under `worlds/` into generated modules, then emits the
module-per-file ESM tree under `dist/` that the package publishes.
`npm pack` / `npm publish` run it automatically via `prepack`.
